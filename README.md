# q4-turn-based-mod
The TRUE repo for my Q4 mod

My personal deliverables were
-Variety of unit types (10 of them) 		
-5 specials (like spells) they can cast		
-Assign terrain and type for traversal 		
-Grid based unit placement and movement
-Turn based movement and combat

TO TEST PERSONAL DELIVERABLES:

First thing:

(first noclip and notarget in console)

(type modHelp into console, this will give you the list of units you may spawn and how to interact with them)

(fly over to flat area of map for better interactions with the mod)


-Variety of unit types (10 of them)each of the 10 units have unique stats and share 1 of the 5 special moves

       - spawn in one of the 10 units and shoot it with the blaster
       - open console and you will see its unique stats (If you shoot one unit and then another, it will trigger combat. 
         Shoot another unit after combat resolves in the console to see its stats)

-Grid based unit placement and movement


       - simply spawn in one of the 10 units
       - shoot one of the units and it will go to your coordinates, this emulate the choice a player has on where units will go
       - keep shooting at the same unit and it will continuously follow you until you shoot a different unit
 
-Turn based movement and combat


       - simply spawn in two (or more) of the 10 units
       - shoot one unit and then shoot another unit that isn't the one you first selected
       - open console and you will see a printed out section called "NORMAL ATTACK PHASE"
       - the console will show the selected unit and opposing unit's turn-based attack that ensued
        
-5 specials (like spells) they can cast		


       - simply spawn in two (or more) of the 10 units
       - first press the 'y' key, the 0 on screen will turn into a 1. this means specials are activated
       - shoot one unit and then shoot another unit that isn't the one you first selected
       - open console and you will see a printed out section called "SPECIAL ATTACK PHASE"
         this means a special move has been used
        
 -Assign terrain and type for traversal
        *not done*
